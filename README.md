#Header Ask a Question Button

Adds an "Ask a Question" button to the header which links to the post page with board selector. If the user is already on a board that board will already be selected on the post page.

**custom-question-button.ftl** is a custom component (named custom.question-button in studio) that can be added to the Page Header section of the wrapper. **page-header-new.ftl** is our header with the button added.
